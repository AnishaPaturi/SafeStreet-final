## 1. Overview of Road Maintenance and Damage Detection
Road maintenance is a critical aspect of urban infrastructure management, ensuring safety and usability of transportation networks. Traditional methods of road damage detection rely heavily on manual inspections, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. These limitations have driven research into automated and more efficient solutions. Various studies have explored sensor-based and image-based techniques to improve detection accuracy and reduce manual effort.

## 2. AI and Computer Vision in Road Damage Detection
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision have enabled automated detection and classification of road damages. Vision Transformer (ViT) models, a novel architecture leveraging self-attention mechanisms, have shown promising results in image classification tasks, including road damage detection. These AI models improve accuracy and speed, enabling scalable monitoring of road conditions. Research has also explored convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and hybrid models for enhanced performance.

## 3. Mobile Applications for Field Data Collection
Mobile applications have become essential tools for real-time data collection in field operations. Several existing apps allow users to report road damages by uploading images and location data. These apps enhance user engagement and provide authorities with timely information, facilitating quicker response and maintenance. Studies highlight the importance of user-friendly interfaces and offline capabilities to improve data collection in remote areas.

## 4. Backend Systems and Data Management
Efficient backend systems are crucial for handling large volumes of image uploads, processing AI inferences, and managing reports. Modern architectures often use cloud services, RESTful APIs, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB to ensure scalability and reliability. Integration of AI models with backend services enables seamless data flow and real-time analytics. Research emphasizes the need for secure data storage and privacy-preserving mechanisms.

## 5. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Chatbots in Public Services
NLP and chatbot technologies have been increasingly adopted in public service platforms to improve user interaction and support. Generative AI models, such as Googleâ€™s Gemini, provide conversational interfaces that assist users in querying reports, submitting issues, and receiving guidance. These systems enhance accessibility and user experience. Studies also discuss challenges in understanding domain-specific queries and maintaining conversational context.

## 6. Email Notification Systems in Maintenance Platforms
Automated email notifications are widely used to keep stakeholders informed about report statuses, updates, and alerts. Integration of email services with backend systems ensures timely communication and improves transparency in maintenance workflows. Research suggests that personalized notifications and multi-channel alerts can increase stakeholder engagement.

## 7. Summary of Gaps and How SafeStreet Addresses Them
While existing solutions provide partial automation and user engagement, gaps remain in integrating AI-powered damage detection, comprehensive mobile and web platforms, and advanced conversational interfaces. SafeStreet addresses these gaps by combining a React Native mobile app with AI-based damage classification, a React web platform for authorities, and NLP-powered chatbots, delivering a holistic and efficient road maintenance solution.
